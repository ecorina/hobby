          The idea for <strong><em>roller blades</em></strong> came before
          roller skates. Inline skates were created in the early 1700s when a
          Dutch person attached wooden spools to strips of wood and nailed them
          to his shoes. In 1863, an American developed the conventional
          rollerskate model, with the wheels positioned side by side, and it
          became the skate of choice. Scott and Brennan Olsen Invent
          Rollerblades In 1980, Scott and Brennan Olsen, two Minnesota brothers,
          discovered an older inline skate in a sporting goods store and thought
          the design would be perfect for off-season hockey training. They
          improved the skate and soon were manufacturing the first Rollerblade
          inline skates in their parents’ basement. Hockey players and alpine
          and Nordic skiers quickly caught on and were seen cruising the streets
          of Minnesota during the summer on their Rollerblade skates.
          Rollerblade Almost Becomes a Generic Name Over time, strategic
          marketing efforts thrust the brand name into public awareness. Skating
          enthusiasts began using Rollerblade as a generic term for all inline
          skates, putting the trademark in jeopardy. However, as of February
          2021, it is still a trademark owned by the company. Today 60 inline
          skate manufacturers exist, but Rollerblade is credited with
          introducing the first polyurethane boot and wheels, the first heel
          brakes, and the development of active brake technology, which makes
          stopping easier to learn and to control. Rollerblade has approximately
          200 patents and 116 registered trademarks.1﻿ Timeline of Rollerblades
          1983: Scott Olson founded Rollerblade, Inc. and the term
          "rollerblading" meant the sport of inline skating because Rollerblade,
          Inc. was the only manufacturer of inline skates for a long time.
          Still, the first mass-produced rollerblades, while innovative, had
          some design flaws. They were difficult to put on, adjust, and were
          prone to collecting dirt and moisture in the ball bearings. The wheels
          were also easily damaged and the brakes came from the old roller skate
          toe-brake and were not very effective. The Olson brothers eventually
          sold Rollerblade, Inc., and the new owners had the funds to really
          improve the design. The first massively successful Rollerblade skate
          was the Lightning TRS. In this pair of skates, the flaws had vanished,
          fiberglass was used to produce the frames, the wheels were better
          protected, the skates were easier to put on and adjust, and stronger
          brakes were placed at the rear. With the success of the Lightning TRS,
          other inline skate companies appeared, such as Ultra Wheels, Oxygen,
          K2, and others. 1989: Rollerblade, Inc. produced the Macro and
          Aeroblades models, the first skates fastened with three buckles
          instead of long laces that needed threading. 1990: Rollerblade, Inc.
          switched to a glass-reinforced thermoplastic resin (Durethane
          polyamide) for their skates, replacing the polyurethane compounds used
          previously. This decreased the average weight of skates by nearly 50%.
          1993: Rollerblade, Inc. developed ABT or "Active Brake Technology." A
          fiberglass post, attached at one end to the top of the boot and at the
          other end to a rubber-brake, hinged the chassis at the back wheel. The
          skater had to straighten one leg to stop, driving the post into the
          brake, which then hit the ground. Before ABT, skaters had been tilting
          their foot back to make contact with the ground. The new brake design
          increased safety.
